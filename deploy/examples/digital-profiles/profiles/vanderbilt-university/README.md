Vanderbilt University digital profile (example scaffolding).

Copy your SDRTrunk-exported configuration for the Vanderbilt University profile into this folder.
Keep the contents generic and avoid committing proprietary system details.

- If you need to pin SDRTrunk to a specific RTL-SDR, set `DIGITAL_RTL_DEVICE` (index or serial)
  and reference that value in your SDRTrunk profile configuration.
