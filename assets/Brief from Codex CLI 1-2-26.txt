Brief

Analog Scanner on the Pi — Repo Location & Services Brief
Repo location on the Pi
The Airband UI systemd unit runs the web UI from /opt/airband-ui/airband_ui.py, which implies the repo is deployed under /opt/airband-ui on the Pi. This is the on‑device path where the UI code is expected to live.
*Source: systemd/airband-ui.service*

Primary services (systemd)
The analog scanner stack is wired up via three systemd units:

rtl-airband.service — the analog scanner itself

Launches rtl_airband with the config at /usr/local/etc/rtl_airband.conf.

Requires icecast2.service to be running (audio streaming dependency).
*Source: systemd/rtl-airband.service*

icecast-keepalive.service — silent fallback stream

Uses ffmpeg to generate a silent MP3 and push it to Icecast at 127.0.0.1:8000/keepalive.mp3.

Depends on icecast2.service being up.
*Source: systemd/icecast-keepalive.service*

airband-ui.service — web UI for control/status

Runs python3 /opt/airband-ui/airband_ui.py.

Provides a UI on port 5050 for profile switching and gain/squelch control.
*Source: systemd/airband-ui.service, ui/airband_ui.py*

Key runtime paths & configuration
Active config symlink: /usr/local/etc/rtl_airband.conf

Profiles directory: /usr/local/etc/airband-profiles
(The UI expects named profiles in this path.)
*Source: ui/airband_ui.py*

Streaming components (Icecast)
The UI assumes Icecast is on port 8000 with a mount called GND.mp3 for playback.
*Source: ui/airband_ui.py*

Example Icecast config lives in icecast/icecast.xml.example; actual passwords are replaced locally.
*Source: README.md, icecast/icecast.xml.example*

What this repo contains (relevant to analog scanning)
