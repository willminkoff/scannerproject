1,2026-01-01T00:00:00Z,Analog scanner not scanning,resolved,Analog scanner was not scanning during last attempt; needs investigation.
2,2026-01-01T00:00:00Z,Remove Nissan Stadium profile from analog scanner profiles and UI,resolved,Remove Nissan Stadium profile from analog scanner profiles and the UI.
5,2026-01-01T00:00:00Z,Update git on the pi so pushes are faster,resolved,Git already up to date on Pi; remote operations are fast (ls-remote ~0.45s).
3,2026-01-01T00:00:00Z,Avoids work and output somewhere,resolved,Avoids confirmed in JSON; UI now shows avoids count and sample for active profile.
4,2026-01-01T00:00:00Z,New design for gain/sq sliders,resolved,Something lager on the screen esp for iphone ui. Also adjust graduation to the real rtl-sdr gain steps and make the sq a simeple 1-10 scale.
6,2026-01-02T00:00:00Z,Last hit not updating in UI,resolved,Last hit pill shows but does not update; verify logging and data source.
7,2026-01-02T00:00:00Z,what does refresh button on ui do?,resolved,Refresh button now documented and tooltip added; it syncs status and sliders without restarting.
8,2026-01-02T00:00:00Z,is the squelch working properly?,resolved,Airband profile: gain <20 and squelch at 8 yields lots of noise pops; traffic sounds scratchy (may be location).Need higher gain but squelch at 9-10 does not suppress noise. Check if other profiles show same behavior.
9,2026-01-03T00:00:00Z,Two columns on the ui for profiles,resolved,Profiles now render in two-column grid cards with single selection; radio inputs removed.
10,2026-01-03T00:00:00Z,optimize for speed,resolved,Profile and apply endpoints now skip restart when no changes; UI avoids redundant profile restarts; remaining latency likely rtl_airband restart time.
11,2026-01-03T00:00:00Z,Clean up noisy scan output,resolved,rtl-airband service uses wrapper script to strip control codes and sanitize logs.
12,2026-01-04T00:00:00Z,change to last hit when empty,resolved,Last hit now shows "No hits yet" when empty; last-hit pill text centered.
13,2026-01-05T00:00:00Z,UI up but no streams play,resolved,UI loads but audio streams do not play; user was on the wrong LAN.
14,2026-01-05T00:00:00Z,Scanner UI flapping red/green due to RTL-SDR busy,resolved,rtl-airband failing to open device; trunk-recorder-staging was holding RTL2838. Stopped and disabled trunk-recorder-staging so rtl-airband owns the dongle.
15,2026-01-05T00:00:00Z,Confirm restart button functionality in UI,open,Verify what the restart button does and confirm expected behavior in the UI.
16,2026-01-05T00:00:00Z,Keepalive broken,open,Icecast keepalive appears broken. Note: while keepalive is broken, buffer time from scanner restart (e.g., change squelch) to when http://192.168.1.124:8000/GND.mp3 stops playing in browser is ~20 seconds.
17,2026-01-05T00:00:00Z,Verify GMRS hits are recorded,open,Add test to confirm hits are recorded for GMRS profile.
