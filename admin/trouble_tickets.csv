1,2026-01-01T00:00:00Z,Analog scanner not scanning,resolved,Analog scanner was not scanning during last attempt; needs investigation.
2,2026-01-01T00:00:00Z,Remove Nissan Stadium profile from analog scanner profiles and UI,resolved,Remove Nissan Stadium profile from analog scanner profiles and the UI.
5,2026-01-01T00:00:00Z,Update git on the pi so pushes are faster,resolved,Git already up to date on Pi; remote operations are fast (ls-remote ~0.45s).
3,2026-01-01T00:00:00Z,Avoids work and output somewhere,resolved,Avoids confirmed in JSON; UI now shows avoids count and sample for active profile.
4,2026-01-01T00:00:00Z,New design for gain/sq sliders,resolved,Something lager on the screen esp for iphone ui. Also adjust graduation to the real rtl-sdr gain steps and make the sq a simeple 1-10 scale.
6,2026-01-02T00:00:00Z,Last hit not updating in UI,resolved,Last hit pill shows but does not update; verify logging and data source.
7,2026-01-02T00:00:00Z,what does refresh button on ui do?,resolved,Refresh button now documented and tooltip added; it syncs status and sliders without restarting.
8,2026-01-02T00:00:00Z,is the squelch working properly?,resolved,Airband profile: gain <20 and squelch at 8 yields lots of noise pops; traffic sounds scratchy (may be location).Need higher gain but squelch at 9-10 does not suppress noise. Check if other profiles show same behavior.
9,2026-01-03T00:00:00Z,Two columns on the ui for profiles,resolved,Profiles now render in two-column grid cards with single selection; radio inputs removed.
10,2026-01-03T00:00:00Z,optimize for speed,resolved,Profile and apply endpoints now skip restart when no changes; UI avoids redundant profile restarts; remaining latency likely rtl_airband restart time.
11,2026-01-03T00:00:00Z,Clean up noisy scan output,resolved,rtl-airband service uses wrapper script to strip control codes and sanitize logs.
12,2026-01-04T00:00:00Z,change to last hit when empty,resolved,Last hit now shows "No hits yet" when empty; last-hit pill text centered.
13,2026-01-05T00:00:00Z,UI up but no streams play,resolved,UI loads but audio streams do not play; user was on the wrong LAN.
14,2026-01-05T00:00:00Z,Scanner UI flapping red/green due to RTL-SDR busy,resolved,rtl-airband failing to open device; trunk-recorder-staging was holding RTL2838. Stopped and disabled trunk-recorder-staging so rtl-airband owns the dongle.
15,2026-01-05T00:00:00Z,Confirm restart button functionality in UI,open,Verify what the restart button does and confirm expected behavior in the UI.
16,2026-01-05T00:00:00Z,Keepalive broken,resolved,Icecast keepalive appears broken. Note: while keepalive is broken, buffer time from scanner restart (e.g., change squelch) to when http://192.168.1.124:8000/GND.mp3 stops playing in browser is ~20 seconds. Notes: keepalive source is up; Icecast shows /keepalive.mp3 mount active; password 062352 confirmed. Icecast logs show fallback triggered on rtl-airband restart; audible delay matches client buffering. Keepalive updated to 8000 Hz mono to match /GND.mp3. Pi commands: journalctl -u icecast-keepalive -n 200 --no-pager; systemctl status icecast-keepalive; tail -f /var/log/icecast2/error.log /var/log/icecast2/access.log; curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/status-json.xsl | jq '.icestats.source[] | {mount, listeners, listenurl}' (during rtl-airband restart); grep -n "fallback-mount" -n /etc/icecast2/icecast.xml
17,2026-01-05T00:00:00Z,Verify GMRS hits are recorded,open,Add test to confirm hits are recorded for GMRS profile.
18,2026-01-06T00:00:00Z,Live hit list page with time and duration,resolved,Live hit list page added with last 20 hits, time, frequency, and duration; Last Hit pill opens page with back arrow; parser fixed for journal timezone format.
19,2026-01-06T00:00:00Z,Hit list duration appears too long,resolved,Duration now inferred from Activity-on bursts with a 10s gap reset; newest hits shown first; note that this is not true squelch open/close timing.
20,2026-01-04T18:42:28Z,Drive last hit and hit list from Icecast metadata,resolved,Last hit pill and hit list now read Icecast metadata; numeric titles supported; journal fallback remains when metadata is unavailable.
21,2026-01-05T00:00:00Z,Optimize systemd and Icecast for faster restarts and reconnections,resolved,Tuned rtl-airband systemd service for fast stops (TimeoutStopSec=1, KillSignal=SIGINT, RestartSec=0); changed ExecStart to direct rtl_airband binary for direct control; reduced Icecast source-timeout to 1s for quicker reconnections.
22,2026-01-06T00:00:00Z,Change last hit frequency should show 000.000 format,open,Last hit frequency shows in 000.000 format. 3 digits on either side of decimal.
23,2026-01-06T00:00:00Z,Audit last_freq.txt usage,open,Locate any remaining references to /run/rtl_airband_last_freq.txt (scripts, services, UI) and decide whether to keep it updated or remove it.
24,2026-01-06T00:00:00Z,add functionality to allow no profile to be selected on either airband or ground,open,Add "No Profile" option to airband and ground profile selections; when selected, rtl-airband runs without scanning that band.
25,2026-01-06T03:40:56Z,Extract configuration into centralized settings,open,Move hard-coded values (paths, ports, secrets) into a single config object backed by env vars and defaults.
26,2026-01-06T03:40:56Z,Add input validation for gain and squelch endpoints,open,Validate gain and squelch ranges before applying changes; return clear 400 errors for invalid values.
27,2026-01-06T03:40:56Z,Refactor apply flow to write config before restart,open,Write and validate updated config first, then restart services only after successful writes to avoid stopped services on failure.
28,2026-01-06T03:40:56Z,Add structured logging for UI actions,open,Introduce logging for requests and profile/apply actions to improve observability and debugging.
29,2026-01-06T03:40:56Z,Split airband_ui.py into modules and static assets,open,Move HTML/CSS/JS to static files and split server/scanner/config logic into separate modules for maintainability.
30,2026-01-06T04:00:00Z,WX gain slider switches profile to GMRS,resolved,Changing gain on the WX profile causes the active profile to switch to GMRS.
31,2026-01-06T04:05:00Z,WX ground profile keeps playing after switch,resolved,Selecting WX on ground causes audio to keep playing even after switching to another ground profile.
32,2026-01-06T14:06:40Z,Allow no profile selected on airband and ground,resolved,Allow no profile selected on both airband and ground scanners so nothing pulls from a unit when no profile is selected (even if it just mutes unit output).
33,2026-01-06T15:31:28Z,Add UI button to play GND.mp3 on Pi audio output,open,Add a UI control to trigger playback of http://192.168.1.124:8000/GND.mp3 on the Pi default audio output; prefer a lightweight player over VLC if possible.
34,2026-01-06T20:55:00Z,Improve squelch scale to find noise floor,open,Allow squelch range below 0 (ex: -10 to +10) or otherwise re-scale UI so users can reliably open the noise floor while tuning.
